//! Regression tests for the two fail-closed CLI guards that shipped WITHOUT one.
//!
//! Both guards were added because a command reported SUCCESS for work it had not done:
//!
//!   * `mindc build` embedded a module that failed to type-check as a runtime-JIT
//!     fallback and exited 0 (#244). `mindc check` rejects the same source.
//!   * `mindc test` reported PASS for assertions that were never evaluated -- inside a
//!     loop, inside a match arm, inside a `region { }` -- and for test files that did
//!     not parse at all.
//!
//! A behavioural guard with no test is a guard that can be silently reverted, which is
//! the same class of defect the guards themselves close. Each test below asserts the
//! EXIT CODE, because that is what a CI step reads.
