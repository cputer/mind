//! Directory identity at the `mindc build` transaction boundary.
//!
//! An explicit `mindc build <file>` relates three directory spellings: the
//! project root the bounded scan resolved, the directory the named entry sits
//! in, and the directory whose build lock is held. Naming the entry through a
//! path with a symlinked component makes those spellings diverge, and every
//! decision that compares them inverts.
//!
//! macOS exposes the same shape through its system directory symlinks: the temporary
//! directory is handed out as `/var/folders/...` and canonicalises to
//! `/private/var/folders/...` — so two concurrent standalone builds under
//! `tempfile::tempdir()` meet it every time. These tests write the same
//! mismatch down with an explicit directory symlink, which enforces the
//! invariant on every Unix runner.
