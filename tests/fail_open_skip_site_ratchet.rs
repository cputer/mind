//! The fail-OPEN skip-and-return prohibition. The ratchet's floor is now ZERO.
//!
//! # What this gate forbids
//!
//! A wide class of integration-test sites carried the shape
//! `if !something_available() { println!("... skipping"); return; }` without
//! ever consulting `MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE`, so `MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE=1` could not
//! turn them into a hard failure and a tier could pass vacuously. Worse, cargo
//! captures the stdout of a PASSING test, so the announcement was not merely
//! tolerated, it was *unobservable*: the tier gate could not tell "asserted"
//! from "executed".
//!
//! The fail-CLOSED helper every such site must route through is `common::gate`,
//! whose contract is proven in `tests/fail_closed_capability_skip.rs`.
//!
//! # Why there is no backlog table any more
//!
//! The first version pinned the CARDINALITY (`n == 256`), which forbids
//! nothing. The second froze a per-FILE table — 136 hand-copied names beside a
//! scanner deriving its scope from disk, two scopes that must agree with
//! nothing asserting they do. Both are gone: the backlog is drained to zero and
//! the gate is a flat prohibition over `tests/**/*.rs`.
//!
//! # The shapes this gate RECOGNISES — and the residuals it does not
//!
//! This enumeration is the claim; `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and
//! `tests/common/gate.rs` point here instead of restating it. The earlier
//! wording — "every skip-and-return site routes through `common::gate`" — was
//! wider than any detector backing it and so read as coverage of exactly the
//! gap it was blind to. Every entry names the escape it closed, each found by
//! mutating the tree under the built scanner, each with LIVE sites riding it
//! while this gate reported clean:
//!
//! 1. An ANNOUNCED skip — `println!`/`eprintln!` naming a skip or a deferral,
//!    possibly wrapped over lines — followed by a `return` OR by a bare `None`
//!    ([`is_bare_none`]). The tail used to require the token `return`, so a
//!    probe that printed its skip and handed the caller `None` was unseen: 4
//!    live sites (`mindc_cache_phase_f`, `g2_differential_mlir`,
//!    `mindc_build_phase_a`, `mlir_build`).
//! 2. A SILENT capability probe: an `if` / `match` / `let ... else` whose
//!    scrutinee is derived from a call in [`skip_shape_scan::AVAILABILITY_PROBES`]
//!    or [`skip_shape_scan::INPUT_READS`], and whose block (or its `else`
//!    branch) exits early without a verdict. Decided over the BRACE-BALANCED
//!    BLOCK by [`skip_shape_scan`], not a line window. The scan was once keyed
//!    on a print macro, so `if !bin.exists() { return; }` was invisible: 17 live
//!    sites. The vocabulary then had no `.success()`, so the FAILED-COMPILE skip
//!    this helper exists for was invisible too: 3 live sites in
//!    `mindc_cache_phase_f`, each grading `ok` on a build that printed
//!    `error[build][E5003]`. And the shape was pinned as TEXT — one probe line
//!    plus a two-line tail — so five ordinary Rust spellings of it passed green
//!    while the gate printed `12 passed`. The vocabulary was then an ALLOW-LIST
//!    OF FOUR calls while this header claimed a residual of three named shapes,
//!    so every other ordinary spelling of the same question — `.is_file()`,
//!    `.is_dir()`, `metadata()`, `try_exists()`, the non-`_os` `var()`,
//!    `.output()`, `.status()`, and a swallowed `read_to_string()` — walked past
//!    it: 3 live sites, one of them on the TRACKED self-host source
//!    (`stmt_keyword_recognizer.rs` graded a missing `main.mind` as a pass) and
//!    one an unrouted ELF-magic skip in `g2_differential_mlir.rs` that
//!    `MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE=1` could not turn into a failure. The vocabulary and
//!    its per-spelling controls are now a BIJECTION, asserted by
//!    [`skip_shape_scan::controls::the_vocabulary_and_its_controls_agree`], so a
//!    spelling can no longer be added without a control proving it fires.
//! 3. The superstring capability test, matched variable-agnostically. It used
//!    to be one literal spelled `stderr.`, so the same predicate under any
//!    other receiver was invisible: 8 live sites.
//! 4. A second reader of `MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE`. `ROUTED_MARKERS` used to accept
//!    the bare strings `MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE` / `enforce_real_backend`, so a
//!    comment merely naming the variable bought a pass; only `gate::`-qualified
//!    call syntax counts now. 17 sites rode it, each hand-rolling
//!    `var_os("MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE").is_some()` — which made
//!    `MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE=0` ENFORCE. They call `gate::skipped`.
//! 5. A `skipped_optional` call site that does not name what is optional.
//! 6. A skip decided by a child process's EXIT STATUS that never decides the
//!    CAUSE. `gate::skipped` names the absence class at the call site and never
//!    reads the failure, so under `MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE=1` it fails closed but on
//!    every other run it grades a compiler regression as a capability gap. The
//!    marker was in `ROUTED_MARKERS`, so the block scan above walked straight
//!    past it: 6 live sites in `phase_g_keystone_bootstrap.rs`, the WEDGE gate,
//!    where a `[E1001]` parse error in the tracked self-host source printed
//!    `ran=0 class=toolchain` and four keystone tests reported `ok`. An
//!    exit-status head must reach `gate::compiled` or `gate::is_capability_gap`;
//!    the subtraction that decides which markers count is owned by
//!    `skip_shape_scan::classifies_text`.
//!
//! The shapes below are the ones this scanner still cannot see, each knowingly
//! deferred. Each was MEASURED escaping the shipped scanner — handed to
//! `skip_shape_scan::skip_block_sites` beside a control that the same run
//! reported — rather than guessed; a residual nobody names is the hole the last
//! escapes came through. What this list does NOT claim is that the tree holds
//! none of them: that is precisely the question a blind detector cannot answer,
//! and the previous wording ("None exists in the tree today") asserted it anyway
//! while `stmt_keyword_recognizer.rs` was riding the fourth bullet below.
//!
//! * A skip announced ONLY in a comment above a bare early-out
//!   (`// LLVM not available; skip corruption check`). 3 such sites were
//!   measured when this bullet was written, all legitimate (2 documented
//!   `STABILITY_SKIP_LIST` gaps in `fmt_stdlib_stability.rs`, 1 guarded in
//!   `mindfuzz_cross_substrate.rs`), so adding it lands red on non-defects.
//!   Upgrade path: route those three.
//! * A COLLAPSED `Option` probe — `if b.exists() { Some(b) } else { None }` on
//!   ONE line. The bare-`None` early-out is decided per LINE because a
//!   token-level `None` matches every `None =>` match PATTERN in the tree.
//!   Upgrade path: require `-> Option<_>` probes to return `gate::compiled`.
//! * A probe behind an INDIRECTION — `if !have_toolchain() { return; }`. Taint
//!   follows a `let` inside one function, never across a call. Upgrade path:
//!   seed the taint set from the return expression of same-file helpers.
//! * An INPUT READ bound to a local whose failure is tested later —
//!   `let r = fs::read_to_string(p); if r.is_err() { return; }`.
//!   [`skip_shape_scan::INPUT_READS`] deliberately do not TAINT: their `Ok` is
//!   payload, not an availability answer, and tainting them flagged the SUCCESS
//!   path of `fmt_stdlib_stability::check_or_skip`. Read failures still count in
//!   a head scrutinee, which is where every live instance sat.
//! * An EXIT STATUS bound to a local before it is tested —
//!   `let ok = out.status.success(); if !ok { gate::skipped(..); return; }`. The
//!   taint set carries the NAME but not the CLASS, so the head reads as an
//!   ordinary probe and the sixth rule above never applies to it. No live site
//!   spells it that way today (pinned as EV5, which is caught as a plain
//!   fail-open skip only because it routes nowhere). Upgrade path: taint with
//!   the probe entry that produced the answer, not with a bare name.
//!
//! The first four share ONE upgrade path, and it is the one worth taking:
//! invert the rule so an UNROUTED bare early-out anywhere inside a `#[test]`
//! body under `tests/` is red REGARDLESS of scrutinee, with an explicit
//! `// not-a-skip:` annotation for the legitimate cases. That fails closed on
//! probe spellings nobody has thought of yet, which is the only version of
//! this gate whose claim cannot outrun its detector.
//!
//! # Scope is read out of the thing being checked
//!
//! The scanned set is `tests/**/*.rs` walked from disk (minus this scanner's
//! own source, whose positive controls must quote the shape it forbids), and
//! the routed-detection is the same `ROUTED_MARKERS` list applied to each of
//! them. Neither is written down twice, so they cannot drift apart.
//!
//! `tests/skip_shape_scan/mod.rs`, which OWNS the vocabulary and its positive
//! controls, is deliberately NOT exempted: it is walked like every other source
//! and comes back clean, because it reads masked CODE and both its vocabulary
//! and its specimens are spelled as string literals. A two-entry exemption list
//! would be the second hand-copied scope this file's doctrine is against. The
//! controls live beside the rule rather than here for the same reason: the
//! vocabulary and the proof it can SEE each spelling are one diff, not two.
