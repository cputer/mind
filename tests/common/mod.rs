//! # Staleness elimination (issue #42)
//!
//! The historic per-file `mindc_bin()` helper resolved the mindc binary by
//! preferring `target/debug/mindc` over `target/release/mindc`. A stale
//! `target/debug/mindc` — left over from an unrelated `cargo test` run that
//! did NOT compile with `--features mlir-build` — caused integration tests to
//! shell out to a WRONG-VERSION binary, producing pre-fix behaviour, parse
//! errors, or phantom bugs (false positives). Each such false positive
//! triggered a debugging chase against a problem that no longer existed.
//!
//! The fix: use `env!("CARGO_BIN_EXE_mindc")`. Cargo sets this environment
//! variable at *compile time* of the test binary itself, pointing at the
//! `mindc` binary that was built for the SAME invocation, SAME profile, and
//! SAME feature set. There is no staleness possible: the path is baked in
//! during the test binary's own compilation, and `cargo test` always rebuilds
//! `mindc` before running tests if any source changed.
//!
//! Reference: <https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html#environment-variables-cargo-sets-for-crates>
//! The `[[bin]] name = "mindc"` entry in `Cargo.toml` guarantees
//! `CARGO_BIN_EXE_mindc` is available to every integration test in this crate.
