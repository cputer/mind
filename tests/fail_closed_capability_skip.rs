//! Fail-CLOSED contract for the shared capability-skip helper.
//!
//! # The defect this gate defends against
//!
//! 24 integration-test sites carried the shape
//!
//! ```text
//! if !status.success() { println!("... build failed -> skipped"); return; }
//! ```
//!
//! with no panic and no `MIND_BENCH_REQUIRE` consultation. On a tier that
//! installs and PATH-verifies the MLIR toolchain, the only remaining way that
//! branch fires is a real compiler regression — which then graded as a PASS.
//! A determinism gate, eleven std-surface runtime-value gates and nine build
//! and cache gates were all fail-OPEN in exactly this way.
//!
//! Every assertion below is on `common::gate`, the single helper those sites
//! now route through, so the contract is proven once instead of 24 times.
//! The legitimate capability skip — a host genuinely lacking `mlir-build` or
//! the `mlir-opt`/`clang` binaries — is asserted to SURVIVE, because removing
//! it would be a different bug, not a fix.
//!
//! The BACKLOG of unrouted sites is drained:
//! `tests/fail_open_skip_site_ratchet.rs` now holds the tree to a FLAT
//! prohibition (floor zero, no backlog table). This file owns the helper's
//! CONTRACT; that one owns its COVERAGE.
