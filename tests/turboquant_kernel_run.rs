// Part of the MIND project (Machine Intelligence Native Design).

//! `bench/turboquant.mind` must BUILD AND RUN, and its own numeric assertions
//! must pass.
//!
//! The kernel states its own standard in its header: "compiling is not passing;
//! the assertions passing is." It checks its numerics at run time against
//! independently derived expected values and returns nonzero on mismatch.
//!
//! Until this file existed, nothing executed it. 4c79ea36 committed the kernel
//! having verified only `--emit-mic3` and `mindc check`; 56c99b47 then ran it by
//! hand once and recorded the result as a dated comment. An audit called that
//! what it is — text-keyed closure of an execution finding: a comment cannot
//! notice the day the kernel's numerics break.
//!
//! It is built in an ISOLATED temp project rather than in-repo on purpose. A repo
//! build compiles every bench source, and `bench/matmul_det_bench.mind` calls
//! `__mind_now_ns` — a deliberately unregistered World intrinsic (it reads a
//! clock) — so it cannot compile natively and the #244 fail-closed guard
//! correctly refuses the whole build. That is a property of the sibling, not of
//! this kernel, and isolating the entry is what separates the two.
