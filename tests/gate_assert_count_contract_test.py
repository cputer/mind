"""Gate test: the assertion count must be EVIDENCE, never a printed integer.

Background — the defect this test exists to prevent
---------------------------------------------------
`scripts/gate_assert.py` publishes the one number `scripts/run_gate.py` trusts:
`asserted=<N>`, refused when it is 0. That number was derivable from a line the
gate simply PRINTED — any `ran=<n>` or `scored=<n>` anywhere in the output
replaced every other piece of evidence. So a gate could report a healthy count
while checking nothing:

  * a smoke printing `(ran={len(CASES)})` reports the LENGTH OF A LIST, not the
    number of cases it executed — emptying its case loop left the count at 8;
  * a gate writing `asserted=99` to stderr outranked the shim's own line,
    because the runner concatenated stdout+stderr and took the last match;
  * a helper line that merely CONTAINED `ran=0` zeroed three real assertions.

The contract enforced here:
  1. a count marker is read only in the two shapes the repo already publishes
     (`SDLC-GATE <name> ran=<n> fail=<k>`, `scored=<n> divergences=<k>`);
  2. a marker never manufactures evidence — with zero evaluated asserts and
     zero verdict lines the count is 0, whatever the marker says;
  3. a gate that writes the contract line itself fails closed;
  4. gate sources may not print those shapes by hand (the lint in
     examples/mindc_mind/smoke_wiring_lint.py).

Run:  python3 tests/gate_assert_count_contract_test.py
Exit: 0 = every case passed, 1 = a case failed (prints the offending case).
