// Part of the MIND project (Machine Intelligence Native Design).

// The differential harness (dlopen + FFI helpers, fixture corpus, etc.) is
// only exercised by the Linux-gated test below; on macOS/Windows the test
// no-ops, leaving these items unused. Silence the resulting dead-code/unused
// warnings off-Linux rather than cfg-gating every helper individually.
#![cfg_attr(not(target_os = "linux"), allow(dead_code, unused_imports))]

//! RFC 0010 G2.1 — Pure-MIND vs Rust IR-text differential coverage harness.
//!
//! Compiles every fixture in the corpus through two paths:
//!
//!   1. **Rust path**: `mindc <fixture> --emit-ir` — the production Rust
//!      pipeline IR-text emitter.
//!   2. **Pure-MIND path**: dlopen `examples/mindc_mind/libmindc_mind.so`,
//!      call `mindc_compile(src_addr, src_len)`, decode the returned
//!      `EmitState.buf` string.
//!
//! Each fixture is classified as one of:
//!   * `MATCH` — byte-identical (Rust and pure-MIND agree).
//!   * `DIVERGE` — both produced output but they differ (real bug).
//!   * `MIND_UNSUPPORTED` — the pure-MIND `mindc_compile` returned a null
//!     handle or panicked at runtime on a fixture the Rust path compiled.
//!     There is no longer a source-level feature pre-filter: the front-end
//!     lowers the whole corpus (fn / struct / enum / extern / module / use /
//!     import / const items + bare const-folded expressions), so a construct
//!     it cannot handle surfaces as `DIVERGE`, not a silent exclusion.
//!   * `RUST_ONLY` — only the Rust path succeeds (Rust exit != 0
//!     means the fixture itself is invalid for some
//!     language feature the Rust path also lacks).
//!
//!   * `MIND_CRASH` — the pure-MIND compiler terminated ABNORMALLY on a
//!     fixture (panic / internal assertion / worker death). A DEFECT, never a
//!     porting-backlog entry.
//!
//! Gate: the test **passes iff DIVERGE == 0 AND MIND_CRASH == 0**.
//! MIND_UNSUPPORTED is expected and does not fail the test — declining a
//! construct is legitimate. CRASHING on one is not, and the two used to share
//! a bucket: a null handle and a dead worker both collapsed to `None`, so the
//! pure-MIND compiler segfaulted 21 times over four days inside runs that
//! reported pass. RUST_ONLY means the Rust path itself could not compile the
//! fixture (invalid syntax, etc.).
//!
//! Coverage report is written to `target/g2-coverage.txt` and printed to
//! stdout (captured by default; use `--nocapture` to see it live).
//!
//! Run:
//! ```
//! cargo test --release \
//!     --features "mlir-build std-surface cross-module-imports" \
//!     --test g2_differential_mlir
//! ```
//!
//! The pure-MIND `.so` is built on demand from the committed
//! `examples/mindc_mind/main.mind` source via `mindc build --emit=cdylib`
//! (no committed binary oracle — a Linux `.so` only dlopens on Linux, and the
//! ELF bytes are toolchain-patch-version specific). This harness is Linux-only
//! (it dlopens an ELF and calls in over the System V AMD64 C ABI); on other
//! platforms the test no-ops as a pass.

    // RUST_ONLY or MIND_UNSUPPORTED. The cheapest way to reach that state is not
    // exotic — run_fixture marks EVERY fixture RustOnly when `mindc --emit-ir`
    // exits non-zero, so a renamed flag silently converts the whole suite into a
    // green run that asserted nothing.

    // The sibling harness already does this (mindfuzz_self_host.py, "refusing a
    // silent green"); this one did not. The floor is deliberately a FLOOR, not an
    // equality: fixtures may legitimately move between categories, but the number
    // actually COMPARED must not collapse.
    // Anti-vacuity floor as a RATCHET, not a token 1.

    // A floor of 1 sits ~95x below the measured value (97 MATCH), so a 98.9% collapse
    // of the comparison -- exactly what happened when libtest swallowed the worker
    // output and every fixture compared as EMPTY -- would still have satisfied it. A
    // floor that cannot fire on the incident that motivated it is decoration.
    //
    // 90 is below the current 97 (room for fixtures legitimately moving to RUST_ONLY
    // or MIND_UNSUPPORTED) while still failing loudly on a large-scale collapse.
