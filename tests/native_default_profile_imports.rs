//! Default-feature-profile controls for the native backend's import admission.
//!
//! These exist because the 24 controls in `native_module_bridge_controls.rs` are
//! erased wholesale by `#![cfg(all(feature = "cross-module-imports", feature =
//! "std-surface"))]`, so NONE of them can observe the branch a default
//! `cargo build` actually ships. This file is their complement: it compiles only
//! when the project resolver is absent, which is the profile CI builds.
//!
//! What it guards, measured on the pre-fix binary before the fix landed:
//! a source declaring a dependency the build cannot resolve COMPILED AND RAN.
//! `import\tabsent_module;` and `use absent_module;` each reached the native
//! bridge's 397-byte ELF fixture, which ran with exit 1. The old detector was a
//! source-text scan, `lines().map(trim_start).any(|l| l.starts_with("import "))`,
//! and it missed both spellings: the grammar accepts any whitespace after the
//! keyword, and `use` is parsed by `parse_use` into the very same `Node::Import`.
//! Lowering treats every `Node::Import` as a compile-time no-op, so no later
//! fence recovers the dropped fact.
//!
//! The same scan was also wrong in the other direction: it refused
//! `import std.math;`, which is satisfied by the seed std blob and is not a
//! local dependency at all.
//!
//! The current fixture is a host executable that drains and captures the input
//! image, then returns fixed bytes beginning with ELF magic. It does not compile
//! MIND or produce an executable ELF. These controls prove admission and source
//! transport, not native code generation or cross-platform byte identity.
