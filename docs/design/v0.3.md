# MIND Design v0.3 (Draft)

This snapshot tracks the v0.3 design for MIND.

## Goals
- AI-native type system (tensors, devices, differentiability)
- Deterministic performance & fusion guarantees
- MLIR-based IR pipeline

## Outline
1. Language Overview
2. Type System (shape-aware, device-annotated)
3. Autodiff Semantics (loops, conditionals, higher-order)
4. IR and Lowering Strategy (MLIR)
5. Runtime & Device Model
6. Open Questions
