//! Entry-rooted admission closure for the `--backend native` multi-module bridge.
//!
//! # Why this file exists
//!
//! The frozen-profile fence ([`crate::ir::frozen_profile::profile_frozen_admits`])
//! scans EVERY function in a lowered module. That is correct for a single
//! translation unit, where every top-level item is part of the program the user
//! wrote. It is wrong once a program imports siblings: an out-of-profile body in
//! an imported module refuses an entry that never calls it. Measured 2026-09-07 on
//! the shipped compiler: a file whose `main` returns `7` is refused `binop.div`
//! because an UNCALLED `unused_div` elsewhere in the file contains `/`.
//!
//! This module computes the set of functions reachable from the declared roots.
//!
//! **That view is DIAGNOSTIC ONLY.** The fence shipped today is applied to the
//! WHOLE IMAGE: `admit_merged_program` runs this admission for its ownership,
//! ambiguity and unresolved-edge refusals and then DISCARDS the restricted
//! module, handing the full lowering to `profile_frozen_admits`. An uncalled
//! out-of-profile body therefore still refuses the build. The reachability set
//! exists to explain WHICH definitions a refusal concerns, not to narrow what is
//! admitted, and the older description of it as narrowing the fence was wrong.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! It is **not** dead-code elimination. The wire image still carries the full
//! source text of every linked module, and the frozen compiler still emits
//! unreachable bodies into the artifact (measured: a module with one uncalled
//! function is 541 bytes against 397 for the same module without it). Restricting
//! the module here changes ADMISSION only. Retaining the text is deliberate:
//! pruning it would change the emitted bytes of single-file programs that contain
//! an uncalled in-profile helper, which the byte-preservation obligation forbids.
//!
//! # Fail-closed obligations
//!
//! Every operation here refuses rather than guesses:
//!
//! * A call whose callee has no definition in the merged module is an
//!   `unresolved_edge` refusal, never a silently dropped edge. Under-approximating
//!   reachability would hide an out-of-profile body from the fence — fail-OPEN, the
//!   one failure this module must not have.
//! * Two definitions of one bare name are a `duplicate_definition` refusal. The
//!   frozen compiler resolves the flat image last-definition-wins, silently:
//!   measured, modules `a,b,main` return 20 and `b,a,main` return 10 for the same
//!   three sources. Until a symbol projection exists, ambiguity is refused, never
//!   resolved by position.
//! * A name colliding with the std seed blob is a `std_symbol_collision` refusal,
//!   for the same reason — std prefixing is convention, not a guarantee
//!   (`std/toml.mind` ships a bare `bytes_eq`, `std/io.mind` a bare `stdin`).
//!
//! Traversal goes through [`crate::ir::instr_bodies`], the single enumeration of
//! body-carrying variants, so a newly added nested-body variant cannot silently
//! become invisible to reachability while remaining visible to the fence.

//
//   `module inner { pub fn v() ... }`   -> "unsupported construct", refused

//   two `fn v()` on ONE line            -> refused, closure.duplicate_definition
