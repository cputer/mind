//! Resolving a native build's source set through the existing project scope.
//!
//! The `--backend native` bridge needs an ORDERED, VALIDATED set of sources to
//! flatten into the frozen compiler's stdin image. That set must come from the
//! project resolver every other path already uses — not from a second crawler,
//! and not from argv. Exactly one argv path reaches the bridge and it is the
//! ENTRY; siblings are discovered, because argv order is not a contract and the
//! image's order is.
//!
//! # Why this is its own module
//!
//! `src/bin/mindc.rs` sits at its size ceiling and the bridge file has its own
//! job. More importantly the resolution decision is separately testable: given an
//! entry path and its bytes, it yields either a single translation unit, an
//! ordered project closure, or a named refusal — with no I/O to the frozen
//! compiler in sight.
//!
//! # The flattening hazard this module exists to refuse
//!
//! The frozen compiler receives ONE flat text. Every top-level `fn` in that text
//! is visible to every other, by bare name, with no notion of module. So
//! flattening a project silently promotes every private sibling function to a
//! callable global — a program that could not compile through the normal
//! resolver would compile here, and mean something different.
//!
//! Module visibility is therefore checked BEFORE flattening, in the owning
//! scope, through the resolver that already knows the answer
//! (`ProjectScope::resolves_imported_symbol`). A reference the project resolver
//! would reject is refused here rather than silently admitted by concatenation.
