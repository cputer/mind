//! The seam between `run_build`'s resolved inputs and the file on disk: the
//! artifact PATH, the `[targets.*]` block name that build carries, and the
//! `LegacyBuildOptions` that thread both into the compile pipeline.
//!
//! None of this decides the artifact NAME — `crate::project::artifact_stem` is
//! the one owner of that, and `crate::project::artifact_dir` is the one owner of
//! the `target/<profile>/` directory. What is left here is the emit-dependent
//! decoration and the option bridge, i.e. exactly the facts that belong to the
//! `mindc build` driver and to nothing else.
