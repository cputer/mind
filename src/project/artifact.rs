//! WHERE a build's artifact goes and WHAT it is called — the one owner.
//!
//! Both facts had two owners that disagreed, and both splits reached disk: the
//! NAME was derived from `[package] name` by `build::run_build` and from
//! `[build] output` (serde default `"app"`) by
//! [`crate::project::build_project`], so the spelling depended on whether the
//! host had a native backend; the `target/<profile>/` DIRECTORY was spelled out
//! separately in `build::default_artifact_path` and in that same function, so a
//! change to the layout had to be made twice or not at all.
//!
//! Everything below the artifact's own extension lives here. The emit-aware
//! caller still owns the decoration (`lib….so` / `.o`), because that is a fact
//! about the emit kind, not about the project.

/// The stem had two owners that disagreed. `build::run_build` derived it from

/// derived it from `[build] output`, whose default was the literal `"app"`.

/// compile path's file to its own spelling on success, while a build refused
/// before that rename (no native backend, `E5003`) left the OTHER spelling
/// behind. So the artifact's name depended on a host capability, a declared
/// `[build] output` silently did nothing, and every downstream reader had to
/// pick one of two rules to hand-type.
