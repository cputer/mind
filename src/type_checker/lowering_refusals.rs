//! Check-time gate for the two lowering refusals that used to reach the user as
//! a Rust `panic!` — issue #237 CASE 2 (a collection mutator whose realloc'd
//! handle cannot be rebound) and CASE 3 (a non-final bare-identifier match arm
//! whose name collides with a registered enum variant).
//!
//! Both refusals are CORRECT: each stands in front of a demonstrated silent
//! miscompile. What was wrong is that they only existed during lowering, so
//! `mindc check` exited 0 on the same source that made `mindc build` abort with
//! rc=101 and a backtrace. An IDE saw a crash, CI saw a crash, and `check` gave
//! a false green.
//!
//! # Why the rules live here and not in a second copy
//!
//! This module does NOT re-derive "is this receiver a tracked collection" or "is
//! this bare name a variant". Two copies of a refusal rule are two answers, and
//! a drifted gate is worse than no gate: it either refuses a program that builds
//! (a regression) or admits one straight into the panic it was meant to replace.
//! So the predicates and the expression walk are DEFINED here and CALLED by
//! `eval::lower`; where a rule cannot be lifted out of lowering (the match
//! desugar), the gate runs the real lowering code with a thread-local refusal
//! SINK armed. The two report sites consult the sink: armed, they record and the
//! walk continues; absent — every real lowering — they panic exactly as before,
//! which keeps the fail-closed backstop for a gate/lowering drift.
//!
//! # Why one call site is enough to make check and build agree
//!
//! `check_module_types_in_file` calls [`check`], and
//! `pipeline::compile_source_with_name` runs that same type-check BEFORE
//! `lower_to_ir`, returning `CompileError::TypeError` on any diagnostic. So both
//! `mindc check` and `mindc build` reach this gate through one function — they
//! cannot disagree — and a refused build exits 1 having written no artifact.
