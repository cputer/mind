# --- rustfmt gate (2026-08-21) ---------------------------------------------
# Block fmt drift BEFORE it reaches CI's `Format Check` job. Fmt drift reded
# main twice in one session; the keystone/build gates a small commit runs do
# NOT check formatting, so a hand-written file that looks clean fails CI. Runs
# only when a Rust file is staged; `cargo fmt --check` is a fast parse+compare
# (no build) in the commit's own worktree (PWD, where git invokes the hook).
# Match the CI `Format Check` gate EXACTLY: `cargo fmt --check` (which respects
# the crate edition + rustfmt.toml). A per-file `rustfmt --edition X --check`
# does NOT load rustfmt.toml or the crate's real edition, so it FALSE-POSITIVES
# on pre-existing lines the CI gate accepts (observed 2026-08-21: an edition-2021
# per-file check flagged an edition-2024 crate + reformatted an unrelated comment,
# blocking a `cargo fmt --check`-clean commit). Correctness > the theoretical
# "undeclared file" gap. Only run when Rust is staged; parse+compare, no build.
