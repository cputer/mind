"""Self-test for the no-AI-attribution gate and for what feeds it.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
A public-repo doc shipped a line naming a model as this compiler's owner, and
every gate stayed green.  Two independent holes had to line up, and each one is
invisible from inside the other:

1. ``scripts/anatomy.sh`` enumerated ``git ls-files --cached --others
   --exclude-standard`` -- i.e. TRACKED **and UNTRACKED** files.  Regenerating
   the index in a checkout that happened to hold a private, uncommitted note
   transcribed that note's title into a COMMITTED, public document.  Nothing
   about the generator's own output looks wrong; the leak is in its input set.
2. ``scripts/check_no_ai_attribution.sh`` excluded ``ANATOMY.md`` from its
   pathspec, so the one file in the tree whose contents are copied from
   arbitrary other files was also the one file the attribution gate never read.

Neither hole is testable by running the gate on the real tree and watching it
pass: a pass proves the tree is clean today, never that the gate would object
if it were not.  So each case below MUTATES a scratch copy and asserts the
gate/generator goes RED (or drops the file).  A mutation that does not change
the verdict is a property nothing is gating.

Scope values are READ OUT of the scripts under test (the scan floor, the
pathspec) rather than hand-copied here -- a hand-copied scope is the next
drift waiting to happen, which is the same defect class this file exists for.

Run: ``python3 scripts/test_no_ai_attribution.py`` (no third-party deps).

      * this file is TRACKED and lives inside the gate's own scan scope, so a
        literal vendor name written here would make the gate red on its own
