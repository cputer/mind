"""Wiring lint: a whole-tree gate's CI trigger must cover every path it scans.

scripts/check_no_ai_attribution.sh and scripts/check_json_not_evidence.sh both
`git grep` the ENTIRE tracked tree -- their verdict does not depend on which
files a push changed. A `paths:` filter on the workflow that runs them is
therefore a category error: it cannot make the verdict more correct, it can only
suppress the run. That is exactly what had happened -- the trigger listed
'**.md' while the attribution gate scans .md/.rs/.py/.mind/.sh/.toml/.rst/.txt,
so a named-model attribution landing in any source file never started the
workflow, and the json-not-evidence gate (which scans ONLY *.mind) could never
fire on the file class capable of breaking it.

This lint fails if that drift is reintroduced. It checks six things:
  1. every gate STEP the workflow must run is present, as code and not as prose,
     inside the job the release manifest names;
  2. no push/pull_request paths filter excludes any path class they scan;
  3. every row of .github/required-ci-jobs.tsv resolves to a real job, with a
     matching check-run name prefix and a non-empty step list, in the workflow
     it names -- and the workflow carrying these gates HAS a row, so a release
     cannot be cut from a commit where they never ran;
  4. the tracked hooks directory runs them too (local defence-in-depth);
  5. that directory carries every hook a maintainer needs, because
     core.hooksPath selects ONE directory and silently drops the rest;
  6. the tracked harness surface (.py/.sh) stays at or below its recorded
     ceiling, so "one more small script" per wave has to be decided rather
     than merely accumulate.

Check 3 is the reason this file grew a manifest reader. docs-claims.yml owns the
gates that keep a named-model credit out of a PUBLIC repo -- in file contents AND
in commit messages, which no later commit can correct -- yet it had no row in the
release manifest, which mirrored ci.yml alone. verify_ci_green.py therefore only
asked whether docs-claims was RED for the released commit, and a workflow that
never ran is not red. Deleting the commit-message step, or the whole workflow,
weakened the release contract with every gate still green.

Dependency-free (no PyYAML): the `on:` block is parsed by indentation, and the
scan scope is read out of the scripts themselves so the two can never disagree
silently. Fails closed -- an unparseable input is an error, not a pass.

# HARNESS SURFACE RATCHET
#
# This repository's product surface is MIND and Rust; every tracked .py/.sh is
# HARNESS -- a CI gate, a driver, or a mutation proof for one. Harness is
# legitimate and load-bearing, and it is also the one file class that grows
# without anybody deciding to grow it: each wave that closes a finding tends to
# add "one more small script", and the total is visible only to whoever thinks
# to count it. A prose baseline recorded in a note is not a baseline -- nothing
# reads it, and the next wave inherits a number it never sees.
#
# So the baseline lives here as an executable CEILING. Raising it is a
# deliberate edit to this line, in the same commit as the files that need the
# room, with the reason in the commit message; that is exactly the friction a
# ratchet is for. Folding a self-test into the gate it proves (the accepted
# pattern: `<gate>.py --self-test`) LOWERS the count, and lowering the ceiling
# to match is what makes the ratchet bite the next time.
# 247 -> 249. Two mutation proofs that could not be folded joined the harness in
# this integration: scripts/test_exec_semantics_gate.py (nine replayed tier logs
# proving the executable-semantics gate attributes a failing target instead of
# exiting 0) and scripts/test_smoke_wiring_lint.py (five fixture repos proving the
# smoke-wiring lint reds a class=gate row that reaches no workflow, and reds an
# "UNCONDITIONALLY" claim written from inside preflight's `--full` branch). Both
# drive their gate through its REAL CLI as a subprocess, so neither can be folded
# behind a `--self-test` flag without importing the gate it is meant to mutate.
# 249 -> 250 for examples/mindc_mind/selfhost_so_provenance_smoke.py, which is not a
# mutation proof at all but a GATE in its own right: it is the only thing asserting
# that _selfhost_so.resolve_so() still refuses an oracle it cannot prove fresh, and
# that no sibling smoke opts out of that contract unnamed.
# 250 -> 251 -> 250: the exec_semantics_markers.sh extraction was reversed.
# Historical rationale moved to docs/gates/exec-semantics-tiers.md; the shell
# functions remain together in exec_semantics_gate.sh, below its source ceiling.
# 252 -> 257 includes the new advance runner and its focused LOOP harness split:
# the stable runner delegates its 35 controls to one shared fixture module
# and two cohesive case modules, while the loop smoke's legacy Rust-seeded
# publication path lives in its own helper. These are reviewed support/test
# modules for existing gates, not new product surfaces; each remains below the
# 800-line source ceiling and the stable runner commands stay unchanged.
# 257 -> 258 adds self_host_alias_controls_smoke.py, a reviewed focused gate
# for the alias environment's collision, scope-isolation, and typed-join cases.
# It is wired into CI and remains below the unchanged 800-line source ceiling.
# 258 -> 259 adds pqc_hybrid_ci.sh, the required two-feature gate that derives
# the exact hybrid test names from libtest and refuses a zero/partial execution.
