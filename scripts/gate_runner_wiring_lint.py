"""Wiring lint: a workflow may reach a gate ONLY through scripts/run_gate.py.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES
----------------------
scripts/run_gate.py exists because an exit code answers "did anything that ran
fail", never "did anything run": it refuses a gate that exits 0 while publishing
no `asserted=<N>` evidence, and it refuses a gate that announced a SKIP. That
guarantee is worth exactly as much as the number of call sites that go through
it. A workflow step invoking the same gate DIRECTLY is a second way to run it —
the way that cannot see a vacuous pass — and nothing noticed that the conversion
had stopped half-way.

Measured on this tree before this lint existed: 11 workflow steps invoked a gate
directly, and two of them were vacuous under the contract. `python3
tests/check_claims_gate_tests.py` exited 0 having reported nine mutation
cases in a verdict vocabulary (`ok `/`BAD`) the shared counter does not read, so
it published `asserted=0`; `python3 scripts/check_release_gating.py` printed a
hand-typed six-line rule list, unconditionally, whether or not those rules had
run. Both would have kept riding green with their case loops emptied.

WHAT IS CHECKED
---------------
Every invocation of a repository script (`scripts/`, `tests/`, `tools/`,
`examples/`) AND every `cargo test` / `cargo bench` step inside a workflow
`run:` block must either

  * be ROUTED — the same command also invokes scripts/run_gate.py; or
  * be EXEMPT — a comment in the same workflow declares
        `# run_gate-exempt: <path> - <reason>`
    naming that exact path (`cargo-test` / `cargo-bench` for a cargo step) with
    a written reason.

A CARGO GATE IS AN INVOCATION, AND ITS EXEMPTION IS A DEFERRAL
--------------------------------------------------------------
The scan started at repository scripts only, which left a whole class of gate
outside the mechanism: a step whose gate IS `cargo test` was not routed, not
required to be declared, and — the part that cost real integrity — not recorded
anywhere as uncovered, while this lint reported that every gate invocation
reaches the runner. Two live defects sit in exactly that blind spot: a
capability skip inside a Rust test (`println!("... skipping"); return;`) turns a
FAILING compile into a PASSING test, and the differential fuzzer reads its
program count from `MINDFUZZ_ITERS` with no floor, so a count of zero yields the
digest of zero programs on both runners — equal, non-empty, green.

Neither is reachable from the Python `asserted=N` contract, and saying so is
legitimate; letting the silence read as coverage is not. So a cargo invocation
is scanned like any other, and its exemption reason must carry a `deferred:`
marker naming the upgrade path: a cargo step publishes no `asserted=N` line
today, which makes its exemption temporary by construction. When the upgrade
lands and the direct call goes, the stale-declaration rule below removes the
deferral with it.

The exemption lives beside the call site instead of in a list inside this file:
a second, hand-maintained copy of the scope is exactly the drift this repo keeps
paying for (a lint whose scan glob and reference detection disagree). A stale
exemption naming a path no longer invoked is itself a failure, so the declared
set cannot quietly outlive the code it describes.

SCOPE DERIVATION
----------------
The workflow set is `.github/workflows/*.yml` — read off the directory, not
typed here. Within each file only `run:` blocks are scanned (`run: <cmd>` and
`run: |` block scalars, tracked by indentation), so a step NAME or a `paths:`
filter entry that merely mentions a script is not mistaken for a step that runs
one. Shell line continuations are joined first, so a command split across lines
is judged whole. A dynamic path (`"examples/mindc_mind/$s.py"`) is matched too:
a loop that invokes a gate by variable is still an invocation.

ROUTING IS A PROPERTY OF A SEGMENT, NOT OF A LINE
-------------------------------------------------
The joined command is then SPLIT on unquoted `&&`, `||`, `;` and `|`, and each
invocation is judged against its own segment: routed means THIS segment invokes
the runner with THIS path as an argument. Asking whether `scripts/run_gate.py`
appeared anywhere on the line answered yes for `python3 scripts/run_gate.py
<gate> && python3 scripts/<other gate>.py` — a routed call and a direct call
chained together, with the direct one reported as routed. That is the second way
to run a gate this lint exists to forbid, wearing the first one's evidence.

Splitting has to stop exactly there: the real tree pipes a routed gate into
`tee` inside an `if`, so the gate and its path must stay in ONE segment. A split
that broke those apart would trade a false pass for a false failure, which is
not a fix.

Dependency-free (python3 stdlib). Fails closed: finding no invocation at all is
a broken scan, not a clean tree, and is reported as a failure.

# SELF-TEST — the mutation proof for the rules above, inside the gate it proves
# ==========================================================================
#
# WHY IT LIVES HERE AND NOT IN A FILE OF ITS OWN
# ----------------------------------------------
# This repository's product surface is MIND and Rust; every tracked .py/.sh is
# harness. A gate and the proof that the gate BITES are one artifact with two
# entry points, and splitting them costs twice: the harness surface grows by a
# file per gate, and the proof can be deleted while the gate keeps riding green
# (a rule with no live mutation proof is a rule nobody has checked since it was
# written). Folded in, `--self-test` is reached through the same module the
# workflow runs, and `scripts/check_gate_wiring.py` holds the whole harness
# surface to a ceiling that this shape is what keeps affordable.
#
# WHAT IS PROVEN
# --------------
#   1. a `cargo test` / `cargo bench` invocation in a workflow `run:` block is
#      an invocation this lint reports, exactly like a script invocation --
#      the blind spot that let a whole class of gate sit outside the mechanism
#      while it reported full coverage;
#   2. it passes only when routed through the runner, or when the workflow
#      declares `# run_gate-exempt: cargo-test - <reason>`;
#   3. for a cargo gate the reason must carry a `deferred:` marker naming the
#      upgrade path -- a cargo step publishes no `asserted=N` line today, so its
#      exemption is temporary by construction, never standing;
#   4. a declaration that outlives its call site fails, so a deferral cannot
#      quietly survive the fix that closes it;
#   5. routing is judged per SEGMENT (`&&`, `;`, `&`, `|`), because a routed
#      call chained to a direct one used to report both as routed;
#   6. splitting stops exactly there: a routed call piped into `tee` -- the real
#      shape in this tree -- must stay routed, or the fix trades a false pass
#      for a false failure;
#   7. the real workflow tree passes AND is non-vacuous: the scan reports a
#      non-zero cargo-invocation count, because finding none is a broken
#      pattern, not a clean tree.
