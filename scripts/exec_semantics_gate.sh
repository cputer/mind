# TIER DEFINITIONS.  RE-MEASURED at the wave that added the fail-closed capability
# gates (`scripts/exec_semantics_gate.sh --print-count`, one run per tier).
# Floors sit a hair under the measured value: a feature-gating accident erases whole
# FILES (dozens to hundreds of tests at once), so a ~0.8% margin costs the gate
# nothing while keeping a one-test environmental difference from redding main.
# Re-derive after intentionally adding or removing tests: --print-count.
#
# A floor is a RATCHET, not a historical note. Left at its first-measured value it
# accrues slack — and slack is deletable test coverage: at 1900 the exec tier carried
# 202 tests of headroom, enough to delete EVERY test in the largest gate file in the
# tree and still print `ok[exec]`. Re-measure at landing, every landing.
