# Build every pure-MIND crypto/TLS std module to a shared object and run its
# official-vector (RFC KAT) driver under tests/*_driver.py. Each driver's exit
# code gates this script; a single wrong known-answer test turns it red.
#
# This is the runner behind the `crypto_vectors` CI job (see
# .github/workflows/crypto-vectors.yml). It intentionally has NO silent-skip
# path: if `mindc` cannot emit a shared object (missing MLIR toolchain) the
# build step errors and the script aborts, so the gate can never pass
# vacuously.
#
# Usage:
#   MINDC=./target/release/mindc scripts/run_crypto_vectors.sh
#
# Env:
#   MINDC   path to a mindc built with the `mlir-build` feature (required —
#           the standalone `--emit-shared` path lowers MIND IR to MLIR text and
#           shells out to mlir-opt/mlir-translate/clang).
#   PYREFS  optional extra dir prepended to PYTHONPATH (for hpack / kyber-py
#           reference packages installed with `pip install --target`).
