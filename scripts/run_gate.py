"""run_gate.py — the shared gate runner that makes a VACUOUS PASS structurally fail.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES
----------------------
Every gate in this repo is invoked as `python3 <gate>` / `bash <gate>` and judged
by its exit code alone. An exit code answers "did anything that ran fail" — it
cannot answer "did anything run". Measured on this tree, with the compiler
binary absent:

  * examples/mindc_mind/rh_f64_aggregate_canary_smoke.py prints
    `SKIP  mindc not built` and returns 0 — a REQUIRED CI step, green, having
    compiled nothing and compared nothing.
  * a name-filtered test selector that matches zero tests reports success.
  * a corpus checker whose on-disk scan and manifest disagree still exits 0.

A fix proven through a gate like that is an unproven fix. Every gate must
therefore publish HOW MUCH it checked, and the runner — not the gate author's
memory — must refuse the answer "nothing".

THE CONTRACT (enforced here, defined in scripts/gate_assert.py)
---------------------------------------------------------------
A gate PASSES only when ALL of these hold:

  1. it exits 0;
  2. its output carries a final machine-readable `asserted=<N>` line;
  3. N >= 1 (or >= --min-asserted);
  4. no output line ANNOUNCES A SKIP — `gate_assert.is_skip_line` (one shared
     definition, applied to stdout and stderr alike) matches both a `SKIP` /
     `SKIPPED` line and a leg a multi-leg gate reports as `SKIPPED` mid-line.
     An announced skip is an unasserted invariant, and it must be a red gate or
     an explicit, recorded deferral, never a silent green.

Python gates get (2) for free: they are executed through `gate_assert.py`, which
counts evaluated `assert` statements and printed verdict lines and emits the
line unconditionally — including on an early `return 0` skip, where the count is
0 and the gate goes red. Non-Python gates are counted by the same verdict-line
rule applied to their output. A gate may NEVER print the contract line itself:
the shim treats that as forgery and forces the count to zero.

USAGE
  python3 scripts/run_gate.py <gate> [args...]     # run one gate under contract
  python3 scripts/run_gate.py --sweep-all          # every gate in the corpus
  python3 scripts/run_gate.py --vacuity-sweep      # THE PROOF, see below

THE VACUITY SWEEP — TWO NEGATIVE CASES, NOT ONE
-----------------------------------------------
`--vacuity-sweep` is the positive control for this entire mechanism: a gate that
can still report success with no compiler present was never testing the compiler.
Being a positive control, it fails when it finds NOTHING wrong with the negative
case — so it cannot itself rot into a vacuous pass.

There are TWO ways to take the compiler away, and only running one of them was a
hole big enough to drive the original defect through:

  1. ENV-POINTED — MINDC / MINDC_BIN / MINDC_SO / MINDC_NATIVE_ELF are SET to
     paths that do not exist. This bites a gate that reads a handle.
  2. UNSET-HANDLE — those variables are REMOVED and every PATH entry holding a
     `mindc` executable is scrubbed, in a tree with no build artifacts. This is
     the case leg 1 cannot see: a gate that defaulted to the BARE NAME `"mindc"`
     never reads the handle at all, so pointing the handle at nothing changes
     nothing and the gate quietly runs a `mindc` off PATH — on a developer box,
     a symlink into a DIFFERENT checkout. Measured on a pristine copy of this
     tree with no `target/` and every handle unset: 21 compiler-dependent gates
     still printed `ALL PASS / asserted=1`, exercising another tree's binary.

Both legs must reject before the sweep passes. Each leg's expected-RED set is
derived from the handles THAT LEG removes (see TOOLCHAIN_HANDLES /
BINARY_HANDLES) rather than hand-copied, so the two scopes cannot drift apart;
every gate in the corpus is required RED by at least leg 1.

Leg 2 needs a tree with no `target/release/mindc`, which the runner cannot
arrange in place. On CI that is free — the sweep is wired before the cargo build.
Locally it runs against a scratch copy of the WORKING TREE built from
`git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` (so uncommitted gate fixes
are under test while gitignored build artifacts are left behind). If neither can
be arranged the leg REFUSES with exit 1; it is never reported as passed.

The corpus scope is READ OUT of examples/mindc_mind/SMOKE_WIRING.tsv (the rows
already classified `gate`) rather than hand-copied into this file, because a
second hand-maintained list of the same set is the drift this repo keeps paying
for. Which of those gates the sweep expects to go RED is likewise read out of
each gate's own SOURCE — a gate is compiler-dependent iff it names a compiler
handle (MINDC / MINDC_BIN / MINDC_SO / the self-host `.so` resolver / the
release binary path). A static lint like smoke_wiring_lint.py depends on no
compiler and is CORRECT to pass without one; excluding it via a hand-written
allowlist would be a second scope to drift out of sync with the first.

MEASURED BEFORE THIS RUNNER EXISTED (the whole justification): with the compiler
binary absent, 108 of the 146 corpus gates still exited 0.
