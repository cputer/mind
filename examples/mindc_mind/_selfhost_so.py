"""Shared self-host `.so` resolver for the examples/mindc_mind smokes.

Why this exists
---------------
`examples/mindc_mind/libmindc_mind.so` is a BUILD ARTIFACT — it is untracked and
gitignored (`examples/**/*.so`). Crucially, `cargo build` does NOT produce it;
only `mindc build --emit=cdylib` does. So an in-tree copy left over from an
older build goes STALE and silently false-fails the byte-identity smokes
(mic@3 flip, self-host loop, native-ELF, ...): the driver bytes drift from the
oracle even though nothing is actually wrong. Worse in the other direction, a
stale oracle that HAPPENS to agree with an equally stale expectation certifies
byte-identity for a compiler nobody is building any more.

`resolve_so()` gives a purely-local run the same guarantee CI has:

  1. `MINDC_SO` set          -> use it, AFTER verifying it is not older than the
                                compile inputs (stamp sidecar, else mtime).
  2. else, release `mindc`   -> BUILD THE SELF-HOST `.so` FRESH via
     binary present             `mindc build --release --emit=cdylib` into a
                                per-tree temp cache (rebuilt only when `mindc`,
                                `main.mind`, `selfhost_driver.mind`, `Mind.toml`
                                or any `std/*.mind` change).
  3. else                    -> the legacy in-tree path, tagged as such.

Provenance, and why it is enforced HERE
---------------------------------------
Every route returns a `ResolvedSo` — a `pathlib.Path` that CARRIES where it came
from (`FRESH_BUILD` / `ENV_VERIFIED` / `ENV_STALE` / `LEGACY_IN_TREE`). The
qualification used to be advisory ("callers that draw a CONCLUSION must qualify
it") and exactly ONE of ~47 importers did so, while the `MINDC_SO` route set no
marker at all — so pointing `MINDC_SO` at the legacy artifact laundered it as a
promised real oracle and sibling gates printed `ALL PASS` on bytes the self-host
loop gate, given the same file, refuses. A contract that every call site must
remember is not a contract.

So `resolve_so()` is STRICT BY DEFAULT: a non-fresh oracle is REFUSED
(`SystemExit`) and no importer has to opt in to that. A genuinely age-tolerant
caller opts out explicitly and NAMES its reason:

    so = resolve_so(allow_stale=True, reason="only reads the ELF header")

Escape hatch: `MINDC_SO_NOBUILD=1` still selects the legacy in-tree artifact
without building — but it is tagged `LEGACY_IN_TREE`, so it is refused unless
the caller also passes `allow_stale=True`. Gate:
`examples/mindc_mind/selfhost_so_provenance_smoke.py`.
