"""
Self-host gap-corpus integrity gate.

Surveys every fixture in tests/selfhost_gaps/*.mind through the pure-MIND self-host
driver `selftest_mic3_module_nfn(...)` and compares each emitted mic@3 module byte-for-byte
against the Rust oracle `mindc --emit-mic3`. The corpus is a fuzz-discovered regression set
spanning struct-lit / field-read / value-if-expr / fall-through-shadow / mixed-prefix /
call-arg / unary-neg construct families.

The gate enforces three invariants:

  * WRONG_BYTES == 0   — the cardinal invariant: the driver NEVER emits incorrect bytes
                         (a silent miscompile is the worst failure mode for a deterministic
                         compiler). Always hard-fails.
  * BYTE_EXACT >= FLOOR — the coverage ratchet: no catalogued construct may regress from
                         byte-exact to fail-closed or wrong.
  * AST-KIND COVERAGE  — every AST node kind the self-host parser declares must be
                         exercised by at least one fixture. A survey can only speak about
                         constructs somebody wrote a fixture for; without this the corpus
                         reports PASS while whole construct families go uncompared.
                         See `ast_kind_coverage` for why the kind list is read out of
                         main.mind rather than restated here.

Per-case rows and what scripts/gate_assert.py counts from them:
  * one `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` line per oracle-valid fixture — a byte comparison (or a
    safe refusal / crash classification) that actually ran;
  * one `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` line per SOURCE_PROBES kind — a fixture-coverage check that
    actually ran against the corpus text;
  * one `[EXEMPT]` line per SYNTHETIC / NO_ORACLE_CONSTRUCT kind — a CLASSIFICATION,
    not a comparison: nothing was byte-compared for that kind, so the row carries no
    verdict token and is NOT counted toward `asserted=`. A kind whose classification
    is stale, or a kind nobody classified, is a `[FAIL]` row like any other.

Verdicts:
  PASS    — 0 wrong-bytes, byte-exact >= floor, every probed AST node kind covered and
            every exempt kind still declared
  FAIL    — any wrong-bytes, a coverage-floor regression, an unexercised probed kind,
            an unclassified kind, or a stale classification
  BLOCKED — .so / mindc missing

CI: point MINDC_SO at the freshly built self-host .so; a missing .so then HARD-FAILS
(refuses to skip, no false green). Local runs default to the .so next to this script.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AST-node-kind coverage lint
#
# The byte survey above can only speak about constructs someone thought to write
# a fixture for. Ten of the self-host parser's AST node kinds had ZERO fixtures
# in this corpus, and four of them (`ast_cast`, `ast_unsupported`, `ast_while`,
# `ast_method`) name construct families that emit wrong bytes or refuse today —
# the corpus reported PASS while the hole was invisible. A survey with no
# coverage floor measures the fixtures, not the compiler.
#
# So the kind list is READ OUT OF `main.mind` (the thing under test) rather than
# hand-copied here: a kind added to the parser with no entry below is a HARD
# FAIL, not a silent omission. Every kind must land in exactly one of three
# buckets, each of which has to justify itself:
#
#   SOURCE_PROBES        — has a source-level spelling; needs >= 1 fixture.
#   SYNTHETIC            — never produced from a distinct source construct
#                          (built by the emitter/desugar), so no fixture can
#                          target it directly.
#   NO_ORACLE_CONSTRUCT  — the self-host front end accepts it but the Rust
#                          oracle cannot compile any source that produces it,
#                          so a BYTE-COMPARABLE fixture is impossible today.
#
# The probes are deliberately syntactic and conservative: a probe that is too
# loose reports coverage that does not exist, which is the exact failure this
# lint replaces. When a probe and a construct disagree, tighten the probe.
