"""Canonical-trace contract for record-field reads, incl. the fixed-array case.

WHAT THIS GATE PROVES
---------------------
`flatten_expr_env`'s `ast_index` arm admits ONE call-bearing base: the
`__mind_load_i64(recv + j*8)` subtree `field_build_load_call` synthesises for a
resolved `recv.field` receiver. Opening a previously fail-closed refusal is only
safe if the bytes that come out are the RIGHT bytes, so every claim here is
measured against `mindc --emit-mic3` and against the ordinary evaluator:

  1. REFERENCE BYTE EQUALITY — a `trace` fixture's pure-MIND `selftest_nb_mic3`
     module is compared BYTE-FOR-BYTE with the reference's. "Non-empty" is not a
     result; the exact bytes are.
  2. RUNTIME CLOSURE — the same source goes through `selftest_native_elf_u`, the
     note-carrying executable path (which itself needs the canonical trace to
     build), and the emitted ELF is RUN. Its exit status must equal the recorded
     value, and `reference.mind` restates each value as an `#[test]` over the
     ordinary evaluator so the expectation is the reference's, not this gate's.
  3. DETERMINISM — every canonical trace is built twice and must be identical.
     This is a regression control, not a formality: the prefold passes rewrite
     against `build_src_intrinsics`' copy when the module source does not itself
     spell `__mind_alloc` / `__mind_store_i64` / `__mind_load_i64`, and while the
     strtab/emit passes still read the ORIGINAL buffer those synthesised callee
     spans resolved past its end — the same program emitted different bytes on
     every call inside one process.
  4. SOURCE BINDING — every expectation lives in `MANIFEST.txt` keyed by the
     fixture's size + sha256, and the manifest must name exactly the fixtures on
     disk in both directions. Edit a fixture without re-deriving its row and the
     gate fails LOUD, so recorded evidence cannot drift from its input.

WHAT IS STILL BLOCKED, AND WHY THAT IS PINNED HERE
--------------------------------------------------
The reference lowers a record with a fixed-array field INLINE — one canonical
slot per element — from CONSTRUCTION onward, and this tree's struct-literal
desugar still lays every field out one slot wide. Measured against
`mindc --emit-mic3`: the bare construction `let r = R { pre: 5, xs: [11,22,33] }`
is 129 self-host bytes against 170; `r.xs[1] + r.post` is 203 against 279 (the
reference stream also carries an `__mind_oob_check` guard call this path never
emits); an all-scalar record of the same shape is byte-EQUAL. So the indexed
admission cannot be byte-exact until the layout lands, and
`srt_canonical_layout_modelled` keeps it fail-closed instead of letting it emit
a valid-looking module with the wrong bytes.

`blocked` rows pin that: the fixture must produce ZERO bytes on BOTH the
canonical and the executable path. When the layout gap closes they will start
emitting, this gate will go red, and the fixtures get re-derived as `trace`
positives — which is the point. A gap recorded as a checked artifact cannot be
mistaken for a gap that was handled.

Re-deriving the manifest after an intentional change:
    python3 examples/mindc_mind/self_host_native_record_trace_smoke.py --bless
and REVIEW the resulting diff — it rewrites the recorded evidence.
