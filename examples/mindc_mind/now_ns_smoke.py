# Project-mode smoke for std.time's `now_ns() -> i64` (the __mind_now_ns runtime
# clock intrinsic). The substrate-object link path only fires under `mindc build`
# (project mode), so this builds a real Mind.toml project that imports std.time.
# now_ns is explicitly non-deterministic (wall-clock evidence timestamps); the
# check only asserts it links, runs, and returns a value plausibly near the host
# wall clock — NOT a fixed value.
#
# Run: python3 examples/mindc_mind/now_ns_smoke.py
