"""
Executable miscompile gate — compile a tiny deterministic MIND kernel, RUN it,
and ASSERT a known output.

Unlike the byte-identity keystone (which proves two builds agree) this gate
proves the compiled code actually *computes the right answer* — it catches a
silent miscompile that is nonetheless self-consistent (e.g. a wrong operator
lowering that reproduces byte-identically on every substrate but returns the
wrong integer).

The kernel (examples/native/ci_kernel.mind) sums i*i for i in 0..10, exercising
`while`, `let mut` re-assignment, integer `*`, `+`, and `<` comparison — the
executable-subset arithmetic that lowers straight through the frozen frontend.
The one true answer is 0+1+4+9+16+25+36+49+64+81 = 285.

Run:
  cargo build --release --no-default-features \
      --features "mlir-build std-surface cross-module-imports" --bin mindc
  python3 examples/native/ci_kernel_smoke.py

The gate copies the exact kernel bytes into an owned temporary directory,
builds that standalone source with `--no-cache`, and loads the resulting
artifact. `MINDC` may point at the compiler under test; `MINDC_SO` is ignored so
an artifact supplied by a caller can neither satisfy the gate nor be removed.
`MIND_GATE_TIMEOUT` bounds the compiler subprocess (900 seconds by default).
